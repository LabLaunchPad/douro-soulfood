 * Playwright configuration for D'ouro Soulfood Bistro.
 *
 * Serves the built output from `dist/client` on port 8788 via
 * `scripts/serve-dist.mjs` and starts it automatically (see webServer below),
 * so `pnpm build && pnpm exec playwright test` is all that's needed.
 *
 * Every public route is prerendered, so the served files are byte-for-byte the
 * HTML that ships. `wrangler pages dev` would additionally emulate the Workers
 * runtime, but it cannot start in every environment and no assertion in this
 * suite depends on it. Header behaviour from `_headers` is NOT reproduced here —
 * it's applied by Cloudflare at the edge, and covered by
 * `scripts/checks/verify-csp-hashes.mjs` instead.
 *
 * Both desktop and mobile projects use Chromium to avoid needing
 * WebKit/Firefox installs in CI. Mobile uses iPhone-like viewport.

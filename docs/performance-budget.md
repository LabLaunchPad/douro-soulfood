# Performance Budget

## Machine Contract

doc_id: PERFBUDGET-01
status: approved
outputs:

- `.lighthouserc.cjs` thresholds
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`'s `lighthouse` job gate

## 1. Context

`.lighthouserc.cjs` already encodes real, enforced budgets — this document doesn't invent new numbers, it explains the ones that exist so future changes are evaluated against them deliberately rather than by accident. Verified directly against `.lighthouserc.cjs`'s `assert.assertions` block.

## 2. Inputs

- `.lighthouserc.cjs`'s current thresholds (see §3 — copied verbatim, not approximated).
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`'s `lighthouse` job, which runs `lhci autorun` against a locally served build of `/`, `/menu/`, `/about/`, `/catering/`, `/contact/` and **fails the build** (not just warns) on any `error`-level assertion.
  - Until the CI-gating fix, this job declared `needs: deploy-preview` and was therefore **skipped on every run** — the budget below was documented and enforced by nothing. Treat any historical "budget passed" claim predating that fix as unverified.
  - The audit must run against a **compressed** origin. `scripts/serve-dist.mjs` negotiates br/gzip because Cloudflare serves Brotli, and the difference is not marginal: the render-blocking stylesheet is 70.9 KB raw versus 10.3 KB Brotli, which alone moved the homepage performance score from 0.50 to 0.86. Auditing an uncompressed copy invents failures that production does not have.
- **Known live breach, not a documentation gap:** mobile LCP measures ~4131 ms on `/` and ~2863 ms on `/menu/` against the 2500 ms budget, with `/` scoring 0.86 against the 0.90 performance floor — measured _with_ compression, so it is genuine. Cause is the render-blocking CSS. Do not resolve this by relaxing a threshold.
- The site's architectural baseline: zero client-JS framework by default (`docs/architecture.md`), which is why these budgets are achievable without heroics — any change that adds meaningful client JS (a React island, per the new `docs/adr/react-islands.md`) is the most likely way to threaten them.

## 3. Required Outputs — the actual enforced budget

| Metric                   | Threshold | Severity          |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| Performance score        | ≥ 0.90    | error (blocks CI) |
| Accessibility score      | ≥ 0.92    | error (blocks CI) |
| Best Practices score     | ≥ 0.90    | warn              |
| SEO score                | ≥ 0.92    | error (blocks CI) |
| First Contentful Paint   | < 1800ms  | error             |
| Largest Contentful Paint | < 2500ms  | error             |
| Cumulative Layout Shift  | < 0.1     | error             |
| Total Blocking Time      | < 200ms   | error             |
| Time to Interactive      | < 3500ms  | warn              |
| Speed Index              | < 3000ms  | warn              |

Pages covered: `/`, `/menu/`, `/about/`, `/catering/`, `/contact/` — defined **in one place**, `.lighthouserc.cjs`'s `collect.url` list. The workflow no longer duplicates them as `--collect.url` flags, so the old "keep both in sync" requirement is gone. Trailing slashes are required (`trailingSlash: 'always'`); without one the audit measures a 301 hop.

## 4. Constraints

- **Hero video delivery contract (2026-09-29 iPhone investigation).** The decorative hero MP4s must be H.264 (`avc1`, High profile OK), `yuv420p`, faststart (moov before mdat), **no audio track** (`-an` — both `<video>` are muted, an AAC track only risks WebKit's autoplay gate), ISO-BMFF brand `isom`. iOS Safari **requires byte-range delivery**: `Range: bytes=0-1` must answer `206` with `Content-Range`, and `Accept-Ranges: bytes` must be advertised — a `200` full-body answer stalls iPhone playback to poster-only while desktop Chrome tolerates it. Verify with `curl -r 0-1` against production after every deploy that touches `public/*.mp4`; the local `serve-dist.mjs` answers 206 so Playwright exercises the same contract.
- **Total Blocking Time's 200ms budget is the tightest real constraint on adding any React island.** A single unnecessarily-hydrated component can consume this budget alone. Per `docs/adr/react-islands.md`, `client:visible` over `client:load` and justifying every island's JS cost exist specifically to protect this number.
- Do not raise any `error`-level threshold to "fix" a failing build — fix the actual regression. Lowering a budget to make CI pass defeats the budget's purpose.
- `uses-optimized-images`/`uses-responsive-images`/`offscreen-images` are `warn`-level today (not blocking) — this is a known, accepted gap tracked separately in the image-optimization work (`docs/audit/image-audit.md`), not something this document silently promotes to `error` without a corresponding fix landing first.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Given a new page is added under `src/pages/`, when it ships, then it must be added to `.lighthouserc.cjs`'s `collect.url` list (one place), with a trailing slash.
- Given a React island is proposed (per `docs/adr/react-islands.md`), when implemented, then its Lighthouse impact on Total Blocking Time must be checked before merging — a regression past 200ms on any of the 5 audited pages is a blocker, not a warning to note later.
- Given CI's Lighthouse job fails, when investigated, then the fix must address the actual metric regression, never the threshold itself.

## 6. Agent Execution Rules

- MUST: treat this document's thresholds as sourced from `.lighthouserc.cjs`, not invented — if `.lighthouserc.cjs` changes, update this document in the same change.
- MUST: evaluate any new client-side JavaScript (React islands, third-party scripts) against the Total Blocking Time budget before merging.
- MUST NOT: weaken an `error`-level Lighthouse assertion to unblock a failing PR. The mobile LCP breach recorded in §2 is the live test of this rule.
- MUST NOT: add a new route without adding it to `.lighthouserc.cjs`'s `collect.url` list.

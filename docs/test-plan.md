# Test Plan

## Machine Contract
doc_id: TESTPLAN-01 | status: approved | outputs: `tests/*.spec.ts`, `.lighthouserc.js`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`'s `e2e-tests`/`lighthouse` jobs

## 1. Context & Inputs
Reflects the actual test suite as it exists today: `tests/home.spec.ts` and `tests/menu.spec.ts` (Playwright + `@axe-core/playwright`), `.lighthouserc.js` (Lighthouse CI), and no other test layer — there is no unit-test runner, no component-test setup, and no `astro check`/type-checking step in this repo (confirmed: no `@astrojs/check` dependency in `package.json`). `pnpm build`'s own diagnostics (Astro's build-time type/schema checking, which validates every content JSON file against its zod schema in `content.config.ts`) is the only compile-time gate that exists.

## 2. Required Outputs
### Coverage that exists today
- **`tests/home.spec.ts`**: content/visibility assertions (H1, CTAs, review badge, featured dishes, "Unsere Geschichte", footer address, skip-link), NavBar presence/links, mobile hamburger-drawer open/close/focus-trap/`Escape`, the Maps consent gate (iframe absent pre-click, present post-click), one repo-wide axe-core accessibility pass, and SEO meta tag assertions (title, description, canonical, JSON-LD).
- **`tests/menu.spec.ts`**: heading/category presence, price formatting, category-nav anchor scrolling, item name/description presence, allergen notice visibility, NavBar/Footer presence, one axe-core pass.
- **`.lighthouserc.js`**: performance/accessibility/best-practices/SEO score thresholds (0.9/0.92/0.9/0.92) plus Core Web Vitals budgets (FCP <1.8s, LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, TBT <200ms), run against `/`, `/menu`, `/about`, `/catering`, `/contact` in CI (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`'s `lighthouse` job).

### Coverage gaps (verified absent, not assumed)
- **Zero test files exist for `/about`, `/catering`, or `/contact`** — Lighthouse audits them, but nothing asserts their content or runs axe-core against them specifically.
- **No test asserts `/impressum` or `/datenschutz` resolve** — both are linked from `Footer.astro` but, as of this writing, only exist on the not-yet-merged `claude/impressum-datenschutz` branch (PR #20). A test asserting these links 200 would correctly fail until that PR merges — this is expected, not a bug to silently work around.
- **No test asserts `MobileBottomBar`'s call/order buttons** point at the correct `tel:`/Lieferando href.
- **No unit tests exist anywhere** — `src/lib/menu.ts`'s filter/sort/group pipeline has real branching logic (category config lookups, drink sub-category grouping) that is only exercised indirectly through `menu.astro`'s rendered output in `tests/menu.spec.ts`, not directly.

## 3. Constraints
- Playwright runs two projects only — `desktop` (1440×900) and `mobile` (375×812, iPhone UA) — both on Chromium (`playwright.config.ts`); no WebKit/Firefox, to avoid extra browser installs in CI.
- `playwright.config.ts` has **no `webServer` auto-start** — a server must already be running on `localhost:8788` (`pnpm dev`, or `pnpm build` + `wrangler pages dev dist --port 8788`) before `npx playwright test` will find anything to test against.
- Selectors use `aria-label`, `id`, and semantic HTML — never `data-testid` (none exist in this codebase, and adding them would be a convention change, not a small fix).
- This sandbox environment (where an AI agent may be authoring changes) has a known limitation: Playwright's browser binary and `wrangler pages dev`'s local runtime both fail to start here. Tests must still be written correctly and will run for real in CI — `npx playwright test --list` (which needs no browser) is the available verification step in-sandbox.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- Given a new interactive component is added (a modal, a consent gate, a toggle), when it ships, then it needs a Playwright test asserting its before/after state — the drawer and `MapEmbed` tests are the reference pattern.
- Given a new page is added under `src/pages/`, when it ships, then it should be added to `.lighthouserc.js`'s URL list and `deploy.yml`'s Lighthouse `--collect.url` flags (both must be updated together — this was previously a source of drift, e.g. `/catering` was missing from both until an earlier cleanup pass).
- Given `pnpm build` fails on content-schema validation, when investigated, then check `keystatic.config.ts` vs. `src/content.config.ts` for drift first — this is the most common real cause in this codebase's history.

## 5. Agent Execution Rules
- MUST: run `npx playwright test --list` after any test-file edit to confirm it parses, even when full execution isn't possible in-sandbox.
- MUST: add or update a Playwright test for any new user-facing interactive behavior (per `CLAUDE.md`'s execution-loop step 4/5).
- MUST NOT: claim a test suite "passes" without either a real CI run or an explicit statement that only static listing/parsing was verified in-sandbox.
- MUST NOT: add `data-testid` attributes as a shortcut — match the existing `aria-label`/`id`/semantic-HTML selector convention.

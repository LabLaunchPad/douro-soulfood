## 1. Product Overview

A restaurant website for D'ouro Soulfood Bistro — a Brazilian/Latin/African fusion restaurant at Auerspergstraße 10, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. Owner: Angela (Brazilian roots).

**Design DNA:** Apple iOS-inspired light-theme design system with warm Brazilian gold/terracotta accents. Structural layout conventions reference talkintacos.net; all colors, fonts, and content are D'ouro's own.

**Goal:** Drive online orders, showcase the menu, build brand presence in Salzburg's food scene.

## 4. Section Inventory (Home Page)

Reflects what `src/pages/index.astro` actually renders — mostly hand-written inline sections, not separate reusable components:

1. **NavBar** — scroll-transition header with a coupled mobile drawer
2. **Hero** — single image (optional video), headline, dual CTA (`HeroSection.astro`)
3. **Review Badge** — star rating strip below the hero
4. **Category Grid** — icon-linked scroll to menu categories
5. **Popular Dishes** — photo grid of featured items, using `PhotoGrid.astro`
6. **Feature Cards** — catering + reviews, using `FeatureCard.astro`
7. **Our Story** — Angela's lockdown origin story, using `OurStorySection.astro`
8. **Photo Gallery** — plain grid, no lightbox, using `PhotoGrid.astro` (same component as Popular Dishes)
9. **FAQ Accordion** — plain `<details>`-based accordion, using `FaqAccordion.astro`
10. **Location/Map** — address, hours, consent-gated Google Maps embed (static placeholder until the visitor clicks "Karte anzeigen")
11. **Footer** — social links, legal, quick nav

## 5. Content Management (Keystatic)

Content editable via the Keystatic admin at `/keystatic`:

- **Menu Items** (collection): name (DE/EN), description, price, image, category, sub-category, dietary tags, allergens, prep time, add-ons, price variants, display order, featured, available
- **FAQ** (collection): question/answer pairs, display order
- **Site Settings** (singleton): site name, tagline, phone, email, address, city, postal code, country, Google Maps URL, Lieferando order URL, logo, OG image, social links, operating hours

The home page's copy (hero headline, story text, gallery images) is currently hardcoded in `index.astro`, not CMS-managed — there was previously a "Home Page" Keystatic singleton, but it was unused (nothing read it) and has been removed. If homepage content needs to become CMS-editable, that's a deliberate follow-up requiring new source images and a copy decision, not a small fix.

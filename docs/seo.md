# SEO: D'ouro Soulfood

Single locale today: **de-AT**. `astro.config.mjs` does have `i18n` and sitemap `i18n` config (Phase 2, see `docs/i18n.md`), but with one live locale it structurally cannot emit `hreflang` or `<xhtml:link>` — verified, not assumed. No `og:locale:alternate` either. See `docs/i18n.md` before adding a locale.

## The head contract (`src/layouts/Base.astro`)

Every page goes through `Base`. Props:

| Prop | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | yes | Rendered as `D'ouro Soulfood Bistro \| {title}` |
| `description` | **yes** | Required on purpose — see below |
| `image` / `imageAlt` | no | Defaults to `/images/og-default.jpg` (1200×630) |
| `canonical` | no | **Leave it alone.** Defaults to `Astro.url.href` |
| `noindex` | no | Emits `robots: noindex, nofollow` and skips structured data |
| `breadcrumb` | no | Trail **excluding** "Startseite"; omit on the homepage |
| `extraSchemaNodes` | no | Page-specific `@graph` nodes |
| `<slot name="head">` | — | For page-specific head tags (e.g. an LCP preload) |

`description` used to be optional with an **English-prose default**, and `/menu`, `/about`, `/catering` and `/contact` all silently shipped it on a `lang="de"` site. It is now required so that omitting it is a visible mistake.

⚠️ **`astro build` does not type-check `.astro` props.** "Required" is enforced by your editor and `tsc`, not by the build. Making it a build gate needs `@astrojs/check`, a new dev dependency — see `.ai/decisions/stack.okf.md` before adding it.

## Structured data: one `@graph` per page

Built by `src/lib/seo/graph.ts`. **Exactly one `<script type="application/ld+json">` per page** — asserted in `tests/home.spec.ts` and `tests/menu.spec.ts`.

- `Restaurant` `@id …/#restaurant` — declared **once** and referenced by `@id` from `WebPage.about`. It previously lived in `Base.astro` and was therefore emitted as 7 rival copies with address and phone hardcoded. Now sourced from `src/lib/site.ts` (Keystatic), including `openingHoursSpecification`, `hasMap`, `hasMenu`, `email`, `logo`, `inLanguage` and `sameAs` (empty social strings are dropped rather than emitted as broken URLs).
- `WebSite` `…/#website`, `WebPage` `{url}#webpage`.
- `Restaurant.image` is the CMS `og_image` brand spread (representative photo);
  `logo` stays the logo only.
- `BreadcrumbList` on the six inner routes; **omitted on the homepage**, where a one-item trail carries no information. There is no visible breadcrumb UI — markup-only is a supported arrangement.
- `Menu` → `MenuSection` → `MenuItem` + `Offer` on `/menu`, derived from the same grouped collection the page renders.
- `FAQPage` on `/`, mirroring the visible accordion.

Two things to know when editing this:

**Prices.** Storage is EUR cents (`1890`). Visitors see de-AT `€18,90`. JSON-LD `Offer.price` must be `"18.90"` — a plain decimal with a dot. Two formatters, one source value.

**`suitableForDiet`.** Only `vegan`, `vegetarian`, `gluten-free` and `halal` map to real schema.org `RestrictedDiet` members. `spicy` and `dairy-free` have none and are dropped — do not invent IRIs for them.

**Honest expectation on `FAQPage`:** Google restricted FAQ rich results to authoritative government/health sites, so this will not produce a SERP accordion. It is still valid markup and materially helps AI/answer-engine extraction — the same reason `/llms.txt` exists. Don't sell it as a rich result.

## The CSP coupling (read this before touching JSON-LD)

Inline scripts are allowed by exact SHA-256 hash with no `'unsafe-inline'`, and **the hashes are generated at build**, not committed. Because the JSON-LD is CMS-derived, a client editing an opening hour changes the rendered bytes; a committed hash would go stale and browsers would block the script with **no build error, no test failure and no visible symptom**. Full rationale in `docs/security.md`.

Practical rule: after any change that touches rendered markup, run `pnpm build && pnpm check:csp`.

Structured data costs hashes: `BreadcrumbList` is per-page-unique, so every page's `@graph` is a distinct inline block. The count went 7 → 13.

## Canonical URLs

**Trailing slash.** `build.format` is unset → Astro's `directory` default, so `Astro.url.href` yields `…/menu/`, and the sitemap `<loc>` and JSON-LD `url` already agreed on that form. The homepage used to hand-set the slashless variant, leaving one page advertising three different URLs for itself. Don't pass `canonical` per page.

## Sitemap and robots

`@astrojs/sitemap` with a `filter` that excludes `/dev/` and `/keystatic/`. That filter is load-bearing: a route's own runtime 404 guard does **not** keep it out of the sitemap. `public/robots.txt` stays a static file — it has no CMS dependency.

## Business-URL discipline (`src/lib/site.ts`)

Ordering, phone, map and place links live in `site.ts`, never hardcoded in
pages: `orderUrl` / `phoneHref` (NavBar, Footer, MobileBottomBar, contact),
`mapsPlaceUrl` (stable GBP place-ID link, review badge), `mapsEmbedUrl` and
`mapsDirectionsUrl` (derived from the CMS address, so an address edit can't
leave maps pointing at the old location). Footer social icons render only when
the CMS actually has that profile URL (Instagram and Facebook alike) — the same
rule as schema.org `sameAs`.

## `/llms.txt`

Generated by `src/pages/llms.txt.ts` (`prerender = true`, so no Worker cost), **not** a static file — its content (address, hours, phone, menu categories) all comes from Keystatic, and a static copy would drift the first time the client edits her hours. Present at `/llms.txt` (manually verified); no LHCI `llms-txt` assertion exists in this repo, so don't claim one passes.

## Images

Alt text must describe the photo, not restate the filename. 18 images were previously alt'd `"Spezialität 1…9"` / `"Showcase 1…3"`; those were replaced with descriptions written after opening each file — most of the gallery turned out to be interior/exterior shots rather than dishes, so the old text was factually wrong too.

CMS menu photos can carry authored alt text via the optional `imageAlt` field, which exists in **both** `src/content.config.ts` and `keystatic.config.ts` (hand-synced — see `.ai/decisions/keystatic-sync.okf.md`). Consumers fall back to the dish title.

## Awaiting business confirmation

Deliberately **not** asserted, because guessing would be worse than omitting:

- **`geo` coordinates** — must be confirmed against the real Maps pin, not inferred from the street address.
- **`acceptsReservations`** — a "Reservieren" chip exists but there is no reservation form; the FAQ says booking is by phone. Asserting a capability that doesn't exist is worse than omitting the field.
- **`aggregateRating` — REMOVED (2026-09-27), not postponed.** The old 4.8/978 was Google's third-party aggregate marked up as the restaurant's own, which Google's review-snippet policy does not allow on a business's own pages — at ANY value, so refreshing it to the current Google 4.7/1,224 would not have fixed the violation. The homepage badge now shows the current Google 4.7/1,224 (Stand: September 2026, linked to the GBP place record) as presentational social proof only, with no markup attached. Do not re-add `aggregateRating` unless the restaurant collects its own first-party reviews on-site.
- **`Review` markup** for the three testimonials in `UserReviews.astro` — **not emitted**. The names are hardcoded in source; if they're placeholders, marking them up is fabricated structured data and a manual-action risk. Confirm provenance first, and move them into Keystatic with attribution if they're real.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm check:csp     # every inline script covered by the SHIPPED _headers
pnpm check:hours                 # every CMS day label maps to a schema.org DayOfWeek
grep -c 'application/ld+json' dist/client/menu/index.html   # must be 1
grep 'rel="canonical"' dist/client/index.html               # trailing slash
```

Manual, and required before calling structured-data work done: run the built `@graph` for `/` and `/menu/` through Google's Rich Results Test and `validator.schema.org`. That is the only real check on `suitableForDiet` IRIs, the omitted-Sunday `openingHoursSpecification` convention, and `Offer.price` formatting.

/**
 * locales.ts — the single registry of every locale this site knows about,
 * live or not.
 *
 * `LIVE_LOCALES` is the one gate that matters: it is the *absence* of an
 * entry, not a runtime check, that keeps a locale from shipping. Nothing in
 * this codebase should ever render a link, a <link rel="alternate">, or a
 * language-switcher entry for a locale that isn't in this array — see
 * `Base.astro`'s head block (canonical/og:locale; hreflang is intentionally
 * absent while only one locale is live) and `LanguageSwitcher.astro`.
 *
 * Astro's own `i18n.locales` config (astro.config.mjs) is kept in lockstep
 * with `LIVE_LOCALES`, not with `LOCALE_REGISTRY` below — a locale only
 * enters astro.config.mjs once real pages exist for it (Phase 3 for `en`).
 * Declaring a locale there before its pages exist would let
 * `getRelativeLocaleUrl`/`getAbsoluteLocaleUrlList` generate URLs that
 * 404, which is worse than not having the code path at all.

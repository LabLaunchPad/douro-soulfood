# Performance Budget

Enforced in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`'s `lighthouse` job against `/`, `/menu`, `/about`, `/catering`, `/contact`: performance ≥0.90, accessibility ≥0.92, SEO ≥0.92 (all `error`-level, block CI), best-practices ≥0.90 (`warn`). FCP <1800ms, LCP <2500ms, CLS <0.1, TBT <200ms (all `error`-level).

**TBT's 200ms budget is the single tightest constraint on any future React island** — a small amount of hydrated JS can consume it alone. `client:visible` over `client:load`, always.

New routes must be added to both `.lighthouserc.js` and `deploy.yml`'s `--collect.url` flags together.

Known accepted gap: images referenced from `public/images/` (not `src/assets/`) pass through Astro's `<Image>` unprocessed — no format/compression gain, only correct `width`/`height`/`decoding="async"`. Documented in `docs/audit/image-audit.md`, not a live regression.

**Full detail**: `docs/performance-budget.md`.

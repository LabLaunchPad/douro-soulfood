# Architecture

Astro 6, `output: 'server'` + `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter (`imageService: 'compile'`) — all 5 real pages prerendered to static HTML at build time; only `/keystatic` and `/api/keystatic` are SSR. No client-JS framework registered.

Content flow: Keystatic admin → commits JSON to `src/content/` → Cloudflare Pages build → live in ~30s. `keystatic.config.ts` and `src/content.config.ts` are two independent schema definitions of the same shapes — keep hand-synced.

Component layout: `src/components/layout/` (Nav, Footer, MobileBottomBar), `src/components/sections/` (page composites — HeroSection, FeatureCard, PhotoGrid, FaqAccordion, OurStorySection, MenuItemCard, MenuBistroCard), `src/components/ui/` (atoms).

**Full detail**: `docs/architecture.md`.

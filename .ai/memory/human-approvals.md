# Human Approval Log

Explicit approvals given by the repo owner in this session, for decisions that otherwise required a stop-and-ask per `AGENTS.md`.

- **Full CLAUDE.md replacement** (twice) — explicit instruction to use pasted content verbatim as `CLAUDE.md`, overriding the previously more-detailed, hand-verified version. Honored both times; content preserved by relocation when a later instruction required `CLAUDE.md` to become a short pointer (see `.ai/decisions/agent-entrypoint-reconciliation.okf.md`).
- **CMS-01 reversing a prior explicit scoping decision** — an earlier session decision had explicitly left near-duplicate menu/gallery markup alone rather than force new abstractions. A later explicit instruction ("run all backlogs") was treated as approval to execute `CMS-01` (extracting `PhotoGrid`/`FaqAccordion`/`OurStorySection`) anyway, since the trade-off had already been flagged in a PR description before the instruction to proceed was given.
- **Merging PRs without per-PR confirmation** — after the pattern was established (explicit "merge PR #X" requests, then later "run all backlogs and merge"), subsequent PRs in the same vein were merged following the same CI-check bar (Build passing, Deploy Preview's known gap excluded) without re-asking each time.

## What this log is for
An agent should check here before assuming something needs a fresh approval — if a closely analogous decision was already explicitly approved, treat that as standing permission for the same class of action, not as requiring a brand-new ask every time. But a *different* class of decision (e.g. installing a new dependency, touching deployment secrets) still needs its own explicit approval — approvals here don't generalize beyond their actual scope.

- **Date**: 2026-08-06
- **Source**: manual entry via memory-append.mjs
- **Type**: approval
- **Insight**: User explicitly deferred the public/images/ -> src/assets/ full pipeline migration (via AskUserQuestion, choosing 'Skip it') rather than having it done automatically, specifically because it requires a Keystatic content-collection schema change (image field type) that risks breaking how the business owner edits menu items in the CMS admin -- one of AGENTS.md's own standing stop conditions.
- **Evidence**: AskUserQuestion in this session: 'Want me to proceed with the full public/images/ -> src/assets/ migration, which requires changing the Keystatic CMS schema?' -> answer: 'Skip it (recommended)'
- **Recommended behavior**: Do not attempt this migration without a fresh, explicit ask -- the direct image-resize fix already merged (PR #34) captured the large practical performance win without this risk; treat the schema-touching version of this backlog item as staying open/deferred, not silently retried
- **Status**: active

# Decision: Performance budget is a real gate, not a suggestion

`.lighthouserc.js`'s `error`-level assertions fail the build, not just warn. This is intentional and settled. If a change regresses a metric past threshold, the fix is to address the regression (remove/defer the JS, fix the image, etc.), never to edit `.lighthouserc.js`'s numbers downward.

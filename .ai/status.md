# Repo Status

> Point-in-time snapshot. Stale the moment this session ends unless a future agent updates it — treat as a starting point, verify anything load-bearing (per `.ai/truth-gates.md`).

## Current repo status

D'ouro Soulfood Bistro site — Astro 6 + Tailwind v4 + Keystatic, deployed to Cloudflare Pages/Workers. `main` branch is stable; `pnpm build` passes clean from a fresh checkout. Legal pages (Impressum/Datenschutz) are live. Google Fonts are self-hosted, Google Maps is consent-gated. The Impeccable design-audit skill is installed (project scope, Claude Code only, `.claude/skills/impeccable/`). A full design-system knowledge base lives at `docs/design-system/` (17 files, real project data, not placeholders). No open PRs, no open issues.

## Active task

SEO Phase 1 (German-only) landed: build-time CSP hash generation, one schema.org `@graph` per page, required meta descriptions, trailing-slash canonicals, generated `/llms.txt`, real image alt text — see `docs/seo.md`.

i18n Phase 2 landed: `LIVE_LOCALES` gate, `astro.config.mjs` i18n + sitemap config, `nav.ts` de-dup, `verify-i18n.mjs`. **de-AT remains the only _live_ locale — no English/Chinese/Portuguese content ships.** `hreflang`/`<xhtml:link>` structurally cannot appear with one live locale (verified). **Phases 3-4 (English activation, zh/pt) are NOT started** — see `docs/i18n.md`.

## Next best action

Phase 1 (SEO) and Phase 2 (i18n infrastructure) are both landed on `main`. Phase 3 (English activation) is gated, not scheduled — see `docs/i18n.md` for entry criteria (100% `en` key coverage, 4/4 FAQ translated, 43/43 `descriptionEn`, prose for 5 pages), none of which are met yet.

## Current blockers

None currently open. The former `deploy-preview`/`deploy-production` GitHub Actions jobs (blocked on a never-configured `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) were deleted rather than fixed — see "Recently resolved". `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is now a 3-job quality-gate-only pipeline (`build` → `e2e-tests`, `lighthouse`); it does not deploy anything. Production deploys happen via Cloudflare's own Git integration on every push to `main`, independently of this workflow and with no manual-approval gate in front of it today — see `docs/release.md`.

Environment-only gaps (sandbox-specific):

- `wrangler pages dev`'s local runtime fails to start in at least one sandboxed agent environment (workerd module error) — use `pnpm build && pnpm serve:dist`, which is also what CI uses.
- Headless Chrome against a live Cloudflare Workers preview URL hits a proxy-TLS interstitial in that environment — audit the local served build instead; never disable certificate verification to work around it.
- Full `npx playwright test` needs a browser binary the pinned version doesn't match; pass a config overriding `launchOptions.executablePath` to the Chromium present in the sandbox. **Corrected claim:** this file previously said the CI `Playwright E2E Tests` job made that sandbox-only and "not a CI gap" — untrue. That job was `skipped` on every run (it depended on the failing preview deploy), so the suite ran nowhere at all, which is how 17 assertions drifted stale on `main`. Both gates now depend on `build` and do run.
- ~~`images.unsplash.com` blocked by the sandbox~~ — **resolved**: that hero fallback image is now self-hosted at `/images/hero-fallback.jpg`, and `images.unsplash.com` was removed from both `astro.config.mjs`'s `remotePatterns` and the CSP `img-src`.

## Recently resolved

- **Mobile LCP budget breach fixed**: homepage 4131 ms → 2481 ms, `/menu/` 2863 ms → 2487 ms, both now under the 2500 ms budget. Cause was render-blocking CSS.
- **Broken/redundant Actions deploy jobs removed** (PR #56): `deploy-preview`/`deploy-production` always failed on a never-configured `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, and were separately broken regardless (wrong Cloudflare product — Pages command against a Workers build; wrong artifact path — `dist/` instead of `dist/client`; wrong wrangler major version). Deleted rather than fixed, since Cloudflare's own Git integration already deploys every push independently and needs no repo secret. Workflow renamed `Deploy` → `CI` to match what it actually does now (quality gates only).
- **Impressum/Datenschutz pages** (PR #20, merged) — real legal-compliance gap closed. Legal-form/UID/Firmenbuchnummer fields remain bracketed placeholders (business-owner-supplied facts, not agent-actionable, per explicit research documented in the PR).
- **Google Fonts self-hosted** — was loading from Google's servers (GDPR/IP-transmission exposure, per the LG München ruling, Az. 3 O 17493/20). Now `.woff2` files under `public/fonts/`, `@font-face` in `tokens.css`.
- **Google Maps consent-gated** — `MapEmbed.astro` implements the two-click pattern; no request to Google fires until the visitor clicks through.
- **Stale EU ODR platform reference removed** from Impressum — the EU Online Dispute Resolution platform was discontinued 2025-07-20 (Regulation (EU) 2024/3228); verified via multiple independent legal sources before removing.
- **Hero video double-load bug** — both mobile and desktop video files were fetched on every page view regardless of viewport (CSS `hidden`/`block` doesn't stop resource fetching). Fixed with a viewport-matched JS loader.
- **WCAG AA contrast fixes** — `--color-brand-gold` used as static text measured ~2:1 against light backgrounds (need 4.5:1); introduced `--color-brand-gold-ink` for text use, kept the original for decorative/icon use. `--color-text-tertiary` darkened (was a 4.1–4.3:1 near-miss).
- **Typography token scale realigned** — the custom `--text-*` scale had invented values matching nothing in real use; realigned to equal Tailwind's actual, disciplined 17-combination usage pattern (298 call sites, zero visual change).
- **Color tokenization** — 38 of 44 un-tokenized `stone-*`/`amber-*`/`zinc-*` call sites routed through proper tokens (Footer → `--color-text-tertiary`, bistro-theme components → 5 new bistro-scoped tokens). Remaining 6 amber accents verified as correctly context-specific, not a gap.
- **Contact page opening-hours alignment bug** — fixed via a real visual audit (Puppeteer screenshots), not just code review.
- **`/menu` performance regression**: image payload cut 80%, DOM size cut 28%. See `benchmarks/reports/MENU-IMAGE-FIX.okf.md` and `MENU-DOM-SIZE-FIX.okf.md`.
- **CSP bug**: was silently blocking the mobile menu and Maps consent-gate in production. Fixed via SHA-256 hash allowlisting; verify with `node scripts/checks/verify-csp-hashes.mjs` after any edit to inline-script-bearing components or a build-tooling dependency bump.
- **E2E coverage**: `/about`, `/catering`, `/contact` added, 76 → 134 total tests.
- **`public/images/` → `src/assets/` pipeline migration**: explicitly deferred, not done — requires a Keystatic CMS schema change the user chose to skip. See `.ai/memory/human-approvals.md`. Do not attempt without a fresh, explicit ask.
- **Spacing (75 half-step Tailwind utility instances)**: investigated, deliberately left as-is — defensible for compact UI (icon+text gaps), not drift. See `docs/design-system/SPACING_SYSTEM.md`.

## Latest known risks

- A 64KB `Footer.*.css` chunk is render-blocking on every route — investigated, legitimate fully-used Tailwind output (zero wasted bytes per Lighthouse), not a bug. No fix attempted.
- CSP hashes are NO LONGER committed — `src/integrations/csp-hashes.mjs` injects them into `dist/client/_headers` at build; `public/_headers` keeps an over-restrictive placeholder that fails closed. Verify with `pnpm check:csp`. Formerly pinned to exact minified byte output and can go stale on any Astro/Vite/esbuild version bump, not just a source edit — run `node scripts/checks/verify-csp-hashes.mjs` after dependency updates.
- ~~CI's `@axe-core/playwright` accessibility gate only runs against 2 of 7 routes~~ closed 2026-08-07 — all 7 routes now covered (`tests/impressum.spec.ts`, `tests/datenschutz.spec.ts` added).

## Last updated

Refreshed after the Impeccable-skill-install + design-system-audit work (PRs #43, #44) merged, and PR #20/legal-fix state was found stale and corrected. Prefer `node .ai/scripts/agent-status.mjs`'s live output over this static file when possible.
